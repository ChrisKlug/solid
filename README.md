# Appliying the S.O.L.I.D principles in C#

This repo contains the code for my presentation about applying the SOLID principles in C#.

## Video

The presentation is available in video format here: https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe/2014/DEV-B210

## Important information

This code is OLD! Is has not been updated in a long time, as there is no need to for the presentation. Thus, it uses and old way to handle NuGet packages and so on. Take it for what it is, which is code to explain the principles, not code for an open source project of some kind.
